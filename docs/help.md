## Help with Failing Builds

Please use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=drone.io) for help with failing builds. Unless your code is written in Go we probably can't provide much help troubleshooting failing builds.

## Filing Bugs

Please use our [GitHub Issue Tracker](https://github.com/drone/drone/issues) for filing bugs and feature requests.

Please __do not__ use our Issue Tracker for generic questions. If you have a generic question about the software or help getting your build working, please use the other communication channels mentioned above.
